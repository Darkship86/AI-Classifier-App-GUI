# AI-Classifier-App-GUI
**Project files for a simple AI Image Classifier App.**

   This is meant to be a template to get you started : 
* ML Models are not included in the project files.
* You must use a model of your own or one from the web to run.

* Please Install Tensorflow, NumPY and Tkinter to run the app.

* The GUI is built using Python-Tkinter, and any sort of
* Machine learning model can be loaded and tested visually.

 * Future Updates will be added for faster efficiency or bugfixes.
