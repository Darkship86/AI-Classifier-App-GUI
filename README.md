# AI-Classifier-App-GUI
Project files for a simple AI Image Classifier App. 
This is meant to be a template to get you started, 
ML Models are not included in the project files.

The GUI is built using Python-Tkinter, and any sort of
Machine learning model can be loaded and tested visually.
Future Updates will be added for faster efficiency or bugfixes.
